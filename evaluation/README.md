This folder contains the experimental evaluation results of DataLossDetector.

The **DLD_analysis** folder contains the results obtained by executing *DLD* on the app used for its evaluation study. Every app is represented by a folder, which contains the apk file of the app itself and 4 folders: **appname_0**, **appname_1**, **appname_2**, which represent the single executions and **dataloss_merge**, which represents the merged results of the three executions. The folders representing the single executions contain 3 folders: **analysis**, which contains the results of the analysis reporting the dataloss failures found and divided in *false positives* and *true positives*, **dataloss_benchmark**, which contains the dataloss failures already known and **events**, which contains the json files useful for replaying the entire event sequence. The merged folder, instead, contains 3 folders: **dataloss_benchmark**, **false_positives** and **true_positives**. All the dataloss failures, except for the ones in the **dataloss_benchmark** folder, are divided by activity from which they were detected during the execution of *DLD*.

The **Alaric_analysis** folder contains the results obtained by executing *Alaric* on the apps used for the comparison between *Alaric* and *DLD*. Every app is represented by a folder, which contains 4 folders: **1**, **2**, **3**, which represent the single executions and **dataloss_merge**, which contains the merged results of the three executions. Each one of them contains further 3 folders: **benchmark**, which represents the dataloss failures already known, **false_positives**, which contains the dataloss failures classified as *false positive* found and **true_positive**, which contains the real dataloss failures found. The dataloss failures in the **false_positives** and **true_positives** folders are divided by activity from which they were detected.
