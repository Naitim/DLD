      "text": "What is it?\n\nThis app is a viewer for passbooks - a passbook could be a e.g. boarding-pass for your next flight, a coupon for a nice hot beverage on the destination, a movie ticket, a membership card - there are a lot of possibilities. Basically it is a replacement for a piece of paper or plastic you would normally have to carry with you - so lets save some trees and reduce waste! \n\nExample passes\n\nDo you need some passes to play around and see things in action? Here are some for you! \n\nHow does it work?\n\nThere are so called pkpass files - you can open them with this app - e.g. when you receive them via email or get an Download-option. The most important content is the BarCode ( QR , AZTEC & PDF417which authorizes you most of the time - but it also has other interesting content like a description - often a time (hat you now can add to your calendar - often also locations (o give you directions) - just try It out! The app is offline usable once you downloaded the pass! \n\nFAQ\n\nHow can I transfer passbooks from iPhone to PassAndroid?\n\n\u2022 Open the passbook on the iPhone\n\u2022 Click on the share icon in the bottom left corner.\n\u2022 Send you a mail with the passbook which your Android device can receive.\n\u2022 Open the new mail on your Android device and save the attachment.\n\u2022 Let PassAndroid scan for passbooks.\n\u2022 The new passbook is visible in PassAndroid.\n\nCredits\n\nBig thanks to Luis Torrecilla for the Design & Cketti for pull-requests! \n\nFeedback\n\nGive feedback in the Google+ Community or you can drop the author a mail. If you like the app rate it on Google Play I also would love to hear stories about where you used this app. \n\nHistory\n\nI stumbled upon Passbook files when i received my ticket for the 29c3 - I liked the Idea - but there was no Android App which was working for me. I saw that the implementation is quite easy ( just a zip container with json and images ) - The first version was build very quick & was working for me ( got entry to 29C3 ) - In the following year I have not worked on this app much as I had no real use-cases but there where a lot of users downloading the app ( nearly 100k now ) and I fixed processing of some passes that where send to me ( some passes contain really broken json .. ) One year later - just before the 30C3 - I came to work a bit on this app again - for 2 reasons: - a friend of mine is very into this whole BTLE thing and location beacon / context aware thing could be interesting for Passbook - but nothing ready yet - I got a mail from a nice designer who did a nice redesign This all was leading to PassAndroid - a completely new version - with a new look and new functions (sorting and adding to calendar alongside pull to refresh a navigation drawer and contextual ActionBar menu \n\nMore\n\nThis app ist best launched with FAST App Search Tool which is available for free and needs not a single permission! \n\nLegal\n\nThis app is not affiliated with Apple - Passbook might be Trademark by Apple, but introduced like a standard so this should be OK \nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED AS IS AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
