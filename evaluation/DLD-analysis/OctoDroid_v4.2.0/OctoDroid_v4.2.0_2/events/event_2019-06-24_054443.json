Extended config available in package.json eslintConfig\n\nTests\n\n1. Added Enzyme to standard test setup\n2. Created mock.store(.tsx) for easier testing\n\nexports\n\n1. No default exports, always use named imports\n2. File heirarchy is as shown below lazy (imports) index (imports) container (imports) component\n\nOther - General\n\n1. File extensions should be .tsx only when React is imported into the file\n2. All file names should be small letters.\n3.
